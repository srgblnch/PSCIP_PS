how to cause:
-	turn on Device Server when the control of Power Supply is not granted to fiber optic connection (it can be granted using Serial connection) 
-	but when trying to repeat in above mentioned condtion everything ok.....????
-	computer hangs

how to come back to normal:
-	 restart PC
	
remarks:
-	probably the reason is in driver (low probability of Tango DS to hang the PC
- 	it not happens when trying to write (send commnad) to Power Supply from simple terminal interface
